# Map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names
# and email addresses.
#
# Two types of entries are useful here. The first sets a canonical author
# name for a given email address:
#
#   Canonical Author Name <author email>
#
# The second allows collecting alternate email addresses into a single
# canonical author name and email address:
#
#   Canonical Author Name <author email> <alternate email>
#
# Mappings are only needed for authors who have used multiple author names
# and/or author emails for revisions over time. Author names beginning with
# "[BOT]" will be omitted from the CREDITS file.
